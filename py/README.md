# Lab 1: Transformations with NumPy
We will in this lab play around with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), "the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python", that we will use throughout this course.

This lab consists of two different code projects, which are both part of this repository, and for the Python part we are using a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for the first part, and the lab guide is embedded in the notebook.

**Start** by cloning this repository on your own machine. Then, open the project in PyCharm. If you are uncertain about how this is done, please take a look at [last week's lab](https://github.com/tek5030/lab_00/blob/master/py/lab-guide/1-open-project-in-pycharm.md). Remember to use the correct repository address!

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Get to know NumPy](lab_01.ipynb)
2. Image transformations with NumPy and OpenCV

When appropriate, take a look at [our proposed solution]()

Please start the lab by going through the [first step](lab_01.ipynb)
