# Lab 1: Transformations with NumPy
Welcome to lab 1!

In this lab, we will play around with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), "the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python", that we will use throughout this course.

The lab consists of two parts, which are both [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in this repository.
The lab guides are embedded in those notebooks, so all you need for the lab should be there.

---

**Start** by cloning this repository on your own machine. Then, open the project in PyCharm. If you are uncertain about how this is done, please take a look at [last week's lab](https://github.com/tek5030/lab_00/blob/master/py/lab-guide/1-open-project-in-pycharm.md). Remember to use the correct repository address!

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Get to know NumPy](lab_01_numpy.ipynb)
2. [Image transformations with NumPy and OpenCV](lab_01_transformations.ipynb)

When appropriate, take a look at our proposed solution for [step 1](solution/lab_01_numpy.ipynb) and [step 2](solution/lab_01_transformations.ipynb).

Please start the lab by going through the [first step](lab_01_numpy.ipynb)

If you haven't completed [`lab_00`](../lab_00), here are the very basic packages required to get started
```bash
sudo apt install python3.8 python3.8-dev python3.8-distutils python3.8-venv
```

### Exercise notebooks
With PyCharm Professional you can run the notebooks from your IDE:\
